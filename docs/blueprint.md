# **App Name**: ChartSight AI

## Core Features:

- Chart Input: Allow users to upload a chart image from their gallery or use their phone's camera to scan a chart.
- AI Chart Analysis: Use Gemini AI to analyze the uploaded chart and provide trading recommendations: Buy, Sell, or Wait. AI serves as a tool, providing analysis but not guaranteeing outcomes.
- Reasoning Display: Display the AI's reasoning behind the trading recommendation to provide transparency to the user. This feature allows users to understand the basis of the AI's analysis, building trust and providing educational value.
- Analysis History & Accuracy Tracking: Display a history of AI analysis, tracking accuracy over time, and notifying the admin when performance declines significantly.
- AI API Integration: Provide an admin interface to manually replace the default AI with another by inputting an API key. Support modular AI replacement by filling another AI Prompt API on dashboard.
- Navigation Dashboard: The application will offer three primary menu options, including: a History of past analyses, a Scan Chart tool with live camera input or file upload options, and a page to change to a different AI via API
